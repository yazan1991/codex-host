# CodeBuddy native Harness plugin

CodeBuddy runs as an independent `codebuddy` Harness using its installed, signed-in CLI. The plugin uses native ACP over stdio through the existing `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` dependency. It does not substitute a Claude executable, translate CodeBuddy into an OpenAI-compatible provider, or store native credentials in codexhost.

## Interface selection

The following official interfaces were compared against CodeBuddy CLI **2.148.0** on Windows, with the user's existing native login, on 2026-09-11 (Asia/Shanghai).

| Interface | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| [CLI overview](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/overview) and bidirectional print mode | Useful CLI automation surface. Stream-json resembles Claude's format, but that resemblance does not establish equivalent permissions, configuration or history semantics. |
| [ACP](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/acp) | Selected. Native Session creation/loading, structured streaming, permission requests, configuration options and cancellation work through one owned subprocess. A live prompt returned `userMessageId`, matching the native transcript and subsequent `session/load` replay. |
| [Daemon](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/daemon) | Provides a shared background lifecycle for native HTTP/Web clients. codexhost already owns Session processes, so this would add another service, lifetime and credential boundary. No daemon is started by this plugin. |
| [HTTP API](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/http-api) | REST Runs and ACP over HTTP are available. The current HTTP documentation and installed CLI use password authentication by default; the daemon page's older local-auth description is not a reliable current default. A second listener and HTTP credentials are unnecessary for a local Harness subprocess. |
| [TypeScript SDK](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/sdk-typescript) | A credible alternative: `query()` and the experimental Session API expose configuration and permission callbacks. SDK **0.3.256** was inspected and probed against the installed CLI. A Session with `requestTimeoutMs` failed during startup; without that option it connected, but returned a legacy 12-model/four-mode catalog instead of ACP's 15-model/eight-mode catalog. The SDK also bundles a CLI and has distinct settings-source defaults. These concrete differences favor the installed CLI's ACP surface for this integration. |
| [Python SDK](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/sdk-python) | Exposes an asyncio client with multi-turn receive, interruption and model/permission controls. It would introduce an additional language/runtime boundary without addressing the observed TypeScript/native catalog differences. It was reviewed, not executed. |

The pre-existing [PR #110](https://github.com/BytePioneer-AI/codex-host/pull/110), inspected at `54abeb46d78bc0f090c0149da355f4ac68316c25`, uses print transport and the older static registration architecture. This implementation uses the current plugin loader and shared plugin route. It does not modify that contributor's branch.

## Ownership and lifecycle

`packages/adapters/codebuddy` owns discovery, ACP, native configuration, history, usage and interactions. Host Runtime retains Thread mapping and public event projection. Its package dependencies and concrete Adapter registration remain unchanged.

The plugin uses the shared executable-discovery mechanism, including npm shims on Windows and version-manager roots on macOS/Linux. `CODEXHOST_CODEBUDDY_COMMAND` can select a specific installation. An explicit invalid installation does not silently fall back. Authentication, native settings, tools and MCP configuration remain CodeBuddy's responsibility. Per-Thread environment values override the factory's environment on both create and resume.

Inspection creates a disposable protocol Session with `--no-session-persistence`, reads native configuration and closes the process. It sends no prompt and persists no user transcript. Results, including negative results, are cached by cwd until explicit refresh; there is no periodic discovery loop.

Each writable Session owns one CLI connection. Model IDs are encoded as opaque `cb.<base64url>` refs. Model, thought-level and permission changes wait for native configuration confirmation. A Model change refreshes the complete available thought configuration. Ordinary prompts never travel through shell arguments.

CodeBuddy 2.148.0 can retain cancellation state after returning a cancelled prompt. After an acknowledged cancellation, the plugin closes that owned CLI, loads the same Native Session in a fresh process, restores confirmed Model/Thinking/Permission values, and only then completes the Host Turn. Connection generations prevent old updates or replay from contaminating the next Turn. Cancellation has a bounded recovery deadline; recovery failure faults the Session rather than reporting a usable connection.

## Capability boundaries

| Capability | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Create, multiple Turns and writable resume | Implemented; source identity and cwd are validated. |
| Streaming text and public reasoning | Separate public Items, with immutable starts and exactly one completion. |
| Tools and approvals | Native calls/results are projected. Repeated `tool_call` frames share one Item; incomplete argument chunks are not rendered as command output. Permission action IDs retain their native allow/reject scope. |
| Questions | Native `AskUserQuestion` is mapped to a Host Question. Its answers are submitted through the native `_codebuddy.ai/resolveInterruption` extension before retiring the pending ACP permission request. This extension is version-specific and covered by a real 2.148.0 probe. The older `_codebuddy.ai/question` callback is also understood. |
| Model, Thinking, Permission Mode | Live configuration, from the native catalog. At verification ACP exposed `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `auto`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, `fullAccess`, and `delegate`. This list is not hardcoded as a catalog. |
| Unattended execution | Requests the advertised native `fullAccess` mode. `bypassPermissions` is not assumed to bypass CodeBuddy's high-risk checks. Policy acceptance is tested; destructive operations are not used for acceptance. |
| Usage | Reads native model-request usage once per request, exposes context size/used, and reports CodeBuddy credits as credits, not USD. Account quota is not implemented. |
| Native history | Read-only JSONL projection follows the current parent chain. Persisted user-message IDs identify Turns. Prompt completion and snapshots must agree on identity. Missing, ambiguous, corrupt or oversized history produces an explicit error. Incomplete native history remains `unknown`; it is not labeled successful. |
| File diffs | Standard ACP diff content is understood when supplied. Native tools still expose their calls/results when no diff is available. This is not a claim that every CodeBuddy Edit/Write supplies a complete historical diff. |
| Fork / rollback | Explicitly unsupported. SDK `forkSession` does not prove a precise ACP checkpoint operation satisfying the Host's prefix and source-isolation contracts. |
| Native Agent subagents | Running/completed collaboration cards and read-only child Threads, with real child messages/tools read from the native transcript. Native Agent IDs survive resume. A background launch acknowledgement completes its tool Item but not the child lifecycle; observation continues without mutating that completed Item, and becomes interrupted when the parent exits without a proven native child-completion signal. |
| Cross-Harness delegation | Uses the shared Thread/delegation path and per-session environment forwarding. Full cross-Harness collaboration, including native visibility of delegation instructions and recursive delegation, still needs dedicated end-to-end acceptance; native Agent subagents alone do not establish it. |
| Commands, compact, Teams | No dedicated Host UI/coordination capability. Member-tagged output is not mixed into the parent's answer. Native CodeBuddy configuration is not rewritten to disable these features. |
| Images | Current public Turn input remains text. Native ACP image capability is not advertised as Host image support. |

The plugin is preinstalled through `scripts/release/harness-plugins.json`; no new SDK dependency or proprietary CodeBuddy binary enters the distribution. Desktop's remaining static Agent list, per-Agent configuration, icon, settings link and production enabled list are updated. Routing uses `encodeHarnessPluginRoute`; no CodeBuddy-specific Host codec or ownership fallback is added. The plugin and Renderer use identical copies of the user-provided CodeBuddy mark captured from `https://www.codebuddy.cn/`, replacing the original neutral code glyph. The SVG is bundled locally without changing its colors, proportions or clipping; asset provenance is recorded in `packages/renderer-extension/src/assets/README.md`.

The README badge uses the round gradient favicon declared by [CodeBuddy's homepage](https://www.codebuddy.cn/home/), rather than the square Desktop mark. The [original favicon](https://download.codebuddy.cn/web/website/423727b4d2d85eaaef1d5b8f9cef78abc8b2a1a7/assets/logo.svg) is preserved in `docs/imgs/codebuddy-favicon.svg`; `docs/imgs/badge-codebuddy.svg` embeds its original vector shapes, gradients and clipping in the existing README badge style. Both are local assets, with no external image dependency.

## Chinese permission-mode presentation

The Renderer translates the known native labels and descriptions when Desktop uses Simplified Chinese. The menu and selected-mode label share the same translation; native IDs, catalog order, selection behavior and danger indicators stay unchanged. English retains the native wording, and unknown labels/descriptions fall back to their original text rather than being inferred from an ID.

The following eight entries were confirmed by read-only ACP inspection of CodeBuddy CLI **2.149.0**, without sending a prompt or changing permissions:

| Native ID | Native label | Chinese label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | Always Ask | 始终询问 |
| `acceptEdits` | Accept Edits | 接受编辑 |
| `plan` | Plan | 规划模式 |
| `auto` | Auto | 自动 |
| `dontAsk` | Don't Ask | 不询问 |
| `bypassPermissions` | Bypass Permissions | 绕过权限 |
| `fullAccess` | Full Access | 完全访问 |
| `delegate` | Delegate | 由父会话管理 |

The Chinese descriptions preserve the distinctions: Don't Ask denies actions that still require permission; Auto can fall back to asking, or denial if prompts are unavailable; Delegate means parent-session permission management, not cross-Harness task delegation. Bypass is described as skipping ordinary permission prompts because the CLI's help explicitly retains HIGH/CRITICAL checks, despite ACP's shorter “Skips all permission prompts” wording. Full Access also skips dangerous-command checks for all agents. This is presentation only, not a Host-defined permission policy.

## Build, installation and validation

`npm run build:typescript` produces `packages/host-runtime/dist/plugins/codebuddy/{manifest.json,plugin.mjs,assets/icon.svg}`. The bundle is relocatable and uses the existing audited ACP/diff/zod dependency set. `npm run build:renderer` builds the Desktop integration. An isolated plugin root can enable it with `{"version":1,"enabled":["codebuddy"]}` in its own `enabled.json`; do not add a second enabled copy where the same ID is already preinstalled.

Verified Windows behavior includes independent plugin loading outside the repository, live catalog/configuration changes, streamed native responses, an approved scratch-file write, question answers, cancellation followed by another successful Turn, and fresh-loader native identity recovery. A separate real Host run loaded the plugin, created a Thread through the shared route, projected a native Turn, closed the Host, resumed the same Thread with its persisted mapping and completed another Turn. The stock-Codex transport in that isolated Host test is a fixture; it is not evidence of a newly deployed Desktop or a real native Codex turn.

Focused tests cover adapter lifecycle, busy/invalid operations, cancellation recovery, interaction validation, immutable events, native branch/history identity, credit accounting, Renderer configuration isolation, generic Host routing, plugin loading and release bundle boundaries. Runtime artifacts and synthetic live evidence belong outside the product repository.

## Native subagents and macOS remote execution

Agent events identify child traffic through `codebuddy.ai/parentToolCallId`. The
adapter consumes that traffic separately from parent messages/tools and correlates
its native request ID to a child under the verified parent's `subagents/`
directory. Only known active child calls are observed, at 750 ms intervals.
Invalid IDs, redirected files/directories, different workspaces, mixed identities
and oversized files are rejected. An incomplete final JSONL line can be ignored
during live child observation, including parent validation, only while it remains
unterminated; ordinary parent-history reads and malformed completed/interior lines
remain strict. Each Session observer keeps a bounded file-fingerprint cache, skips
unchanged full-file reads and parsing, and invalidates on path, inode, size or
nanosecond timestamp changes. A reusable cache entry is installed only when file
identity and metadata are stable before and after the read and the byte count agrees;
changed files are reread in full rather than incrementally. Cache hits still
revalidate canonical paths, workspace ownership and transcript identity. Read
failures and assistant/file messages never imply child completion, and closing the
parent prevents in-flight observations from emitting late events.

Managed macOS remote execution uses the [native Aqua broker](../../platforms/macos/native-aqua-broker.md):

```sh
codexhost broker install --harness codebuddy
codexhost broker status --harness codebuddy
```

The native CLI runs in the login user's Aqua session, keeping its own credentials.
The SSH/Remote Control Host connects over an authenticated owner-only local socket;
the adapter does not fall back to another Harness or an SSH CLI process.

The implementation was packaged and tested on Windows and macOS in a combined
0.6.2 candidate before being split into an independent CodeBuddy PR. Agent state,
live child history, mode changes and same-child resume were verified through the
real Mac Remote Host and official SSH proxy. The user also verified local Desktop
subagents, Windows-to-Mac remote sessions, and Mac-to-Windows Remote Control.
Those user confirmations are separate from automated adapter/Host tests. Building
this branch does not itself restart or deploy any existing Desktop installation.

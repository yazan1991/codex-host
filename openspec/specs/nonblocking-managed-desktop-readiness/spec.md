# nonblocking-managed-desktop-readiness Specification

## Purpose

Define non-blocking managed Desktop startup, background Renderer integration recovery, bounded attachment behavior during recovery, and official Codex fallback while external Agent capabilities are unavailable.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Managed Desktop startup SHALL survive Renderer capability unavailability
The Desktop Controller SHALL treat initial Title Policy, Agent routing, Draft routing, and unclassified Renderer inspection failures as recoverable internal installation states. It MUST NOT emit those failures as blocking compatibility readiness, exit solely because of them, or cause the Launcher to show a compatibility-boundary dialog.

#### Scenario: Initial Agent routing structure is unavailable
- **WHEN** the initial Renderer installation cannot bind a supported Composer Model controller or Agent routing target
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL keep the managed process chain running and publish non-blocking managed readiness
- **AND** the Launcher SHALL enter codexhost without displaying `agent-routing-structure-unavailable`

#### Scenario: Initial Draft routing structure is unavailable
- **WHEN** the initial Renderer installation cannot install the owned Draft Prewarm Policy
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL retain that failure only as a recoverable installation state
- **AND** the Launcher SHALL enter codexhost without displaying `draft-routing-structure-unavailable`

#### Scenario: Initial title structure is unavailable
- **WHEN** the initial Renderer installation cannot establish Title Policy ownership
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL retain that failure only as a recoverable installation state
- **AND** the Launcher SHALL enter codexhost without displaying `title-isolation-structure-unavailable`

#### Scenario: Initial inspection process fails
- **WHEN** Renderer Bundle reading, Inspector execution, or another installation operation fails before a Session is available
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL retain that failure only as a recoverable installation state
- **AND** the Launcher SHALL enter codexhost without displaying `compatibility-detection` or `inspection-failed`

### Requirement: Controller SHALL recover Renderer integration in the background
The Controller SHALL serialize complete direct Renderer CDP Session installation and use. While no valid Session exists, it SHALL retry installation with bounded exponential backoff from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. After a Session becomes ready it SHALL reset that backoff and validate the existing target and binding; a later target, connection, draft-policy, or readiness failure SHALL close and clear that Session and return to complete target discovery and installation retry without terminating the managed Desktop. A failed installation MUST NOT leave or publish an installed Session object.

#### Scenario: User logs in after managed startup
- **WHEN** initial installation fails because the logged-out Renderer has no supported Composer Model or Request Manager state and the user later reaches a supported Composer
- **THEN** a subsequent Controller retry SHALL discover the primary target and install the complete Renderer Session
- **AND** external controls SHALL become available only after existing local prerequisites report ready

#### Scenario: Ready Session loses its Renderer binding
- **WHEN** `ensureInstalled()` fails after a Session previously became ready
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL close and clear the failed Session and continue running
- **AND** it SHALL retry complete target discovery and installation without producing a blocking compatibility result

#### Scenario: Initial direct CDP installation fails
- **WHEN** target discovery, WebSocket connection, source registration, immediate injection, draft routing, or binding validation fails
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL retain no installed Session
- **AND** attachment SHALL not claim activation success until a later complete installation succeeds

### Requirement: Controller attachment SHALL remain bounded during recovery
The Controller SHALL start its authenticated loopback attachment server even when no Renderer Session is currently available. The authenticated `ATTACH` operation SHALL remain serialized and MUST NOT claim success unless the required Session operation completes. Unsupported commands, including the retired compatibility-update operation, SHALL be rejected.

#### Scenario: Attach arrives while installation is unavailable
- **WHEN** a valid attachment request arrives while the Controller has no Session
- **THEN** the Controller SHALL make one serialized bounded installation attempt
- **AND** it SHALL activate the Desktop only after installation succeeds or return the existing bounded failure response

### Requirement: Official Codex fallback SHALL remain available without external readiness
A managed Host request without a valid external transport carrier SHALL continue to route to official Codex while Renderer integration is unavailable. The system MUST NOT synthesize an external carrier or infer a Harness from the configured default Agent.

#### Scenario: User submits through an unmodified official Composer
- **WHEN** Renderer integration is unavailable and Desktop emits a request without an external transport carrier
- **THEN** Host SHALL route the request to official Codex
- **AND** MUST NOT create a Pi or Claude Code Native Session

### Requirement: Non-blocking recovery SHALL NOT expose a compatibility-dialog control path
The production Launcher, Controller attachment protocol, Renderer Control Session, and Renderer binding SHALL NOT expose a compatibility-dialog-specific warning acknowledgement or update command. Removing that path MUST NOT remove the normal Settings update operations or runtime Renderer recovery.

#### Scenario: Controlled instance attachment protocol is used
- **WHEN** a Launcher attaches to an existing controlled Desktop
- **THEN** the authenticated Controller protocol SHALL support bounded Desktop activation
- **AND** SHALL NOT accept a compatibility-dialog-specific update request

#### Scenario: User checks for updates in Settings
- **WHEN** the Renderer Settings update page invokes the fixed update operations
- **THEN** Host update check, start, and status operations SHALL remain available
- **AND** their behavior SHALL NOT depend on a Launcher compatibility dialog

#### Scenario: Renderer integration is unavailable
- **WHEN** Title, Agent, Draft, or inspection installation fails
- **THEN** Controller SHALL retain background recovery and official Codex fallback
- **AND** SHALL NOT display, request, or persist a compatibility warning acknowledgement

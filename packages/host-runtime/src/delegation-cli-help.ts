const COMMAND_HELP = {
  "harness list": `codexhost harness list [--format json|compact]
List Harnesses available in the active Runtime.`,
  "harness inspect": `codexhost harness inspect <harness> [--cwd <path>] [--refresh true|false] [--format json|compact]
Read available Models, native defaults, Thinking options, and configuration capabilities.
Use the returned Model and Thinking IDs for explicit selections.`,
  "delegate start": `codexhost delegate start --harness <id> --task <text> [--cwd <path>] [--model <opaque-ref>] [--thinking <option-id>] [--parent-thread <thread>] [--request-id <id>] [--format json|compact]
Create an independent child Thread, submit the task, and return immediately.
Omit --model and --thinking to use the Harness native defaults.
--cwd overrides the child workspace. Otherwise use the resolved parent Thread workspace, then the Host Runtime process cwd.
--parent-thread overrides caller inference. PARENT_THREAD_AMBIGUOUS requires an explicit parent.
Reuse --request-id for an idempotent retry. Identical recent parent/target/task/configuration requests are also deduplicated briefly.
The response confirms cwd and parent. Use its Thread reference with thread read, wait, send, or cancel.`,
  "thread send": `codexhost thread send <thread> --message <text> [--format json|compact]
Start a new Turn in an idle writable Thread and return immediately.
THREAD_BUSY means the current Turn is still active: wait or cancel before sending. Messages are not queued.`,
  "thread cancel": `codexhost thread cancel <thread> [--format json|compact]
Request cancellation of the active Turn while preserving the Thread and history.
cancelled=true (compact: cancelRequested=true) means the cancellation request was accepted. Read or wait to confirm the terminal state. An idle Thread returns false.`,
  "thread read": `codexhost thread read <thread> [--view result|messages] [--cursor <cursor>] [--limit <n>] [--format json|compact]
Read immediately without starting a Turn. The default result view reports the latest Turn's status and result.
The messages view pages visible user/Agent messages, oldest first. Default limit 25, maximum 100; --cursor and --limit require --view messages.
hasMore describes remaining messages now. Save nextCursor for later incremental reads even when hasMore=false.
Compact messages output contains only the message page and status; compact result output includes the latest nonempty progress while running.
Full JSON retains the complete snapshot. Tool calls/output, file activity, and reasoning are not included in either format.`,
  "thread wait": `codexhost thread wait <thread> [--timeout-ms <n>] [--view result|messages] [--cursor <cursor>] [--limit <n>] [--format json|compact]
Wait until the Thread is terminal or the timeout expires (default 30000 ms), then return the same snapshot as thread read plus timedOut.
timedOut=true is a running checkpoint: the child keeps running. The response already includes the result when available; another read is unnecessary unless more information is needed.
Message pagination uses --view messages, default limit 25, maximum 100. hasMore is for current pages; nextCursor also supports future incremental reads.`,
  "thread list": `codexhost thread list [--cwd <path>] [--parent <thread>] [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>] [--sort created-asc|created-desc|updated-asc|updated-desc|recency-asc|recency-desc] [--format json|compact]
Find existing Threads by workspace, or use --parent to list a Thread's delegated children.
Workspace listing defaults to the caller process cwd. Default limit 25 (maximum 100), sorted created-desc.
--parent uses Delegation relationships. A null nextCursor ends the list.
Compact output keeps task links, Harness, status, title, and workspace.`,

const COMMON_HELP = `Thread references accept a bare ID or codex://threads/<id>.
--format json is the compatible full JSON output (default); --format compact returns concise JSON using task links instead of internal IDs.
Success is written to stdout; errors {"error":{"code":"...","message":"...","details":{...}}} go to stderr with exit code 1. Exit code 0 means the command succeeded, not that the delegated task succeeded.
read/wait are non-consuming. Native Codex callers need local Runtime access; RUNTIME_UNREACHABLE requires the Host-provided environment and a sandbox that permits that connection.
Native Codex shell commands also need the Host-provided CODEXHOST_* environment variables. If shell_environment_policy filters them, prefer inherit = "all" with ignore_default_excludes = true and a narrow include_only containing "CODEXHOST_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT" and "CODEXHOST_RUNTIME_TOKEN" plus the variables required by the platform and invoked tools. Avoid unconstrained inherit = "all", which forwards unrelated ambient variables.`;
